The STSELib middleware provides a complete set of high-level Application Programming Interface functions to the embedded system developer. This Middleware abstract the build and the sequencing of the commands required to ensure device , accessories and consumable brand protection using STMicroelectronics STSAFE-A secure element family.

This middleware allows a seamless integration of one or multiple STSAFE-A in various host MCU/MPU ecosystem.

The STSELib middleware is composed of three software modules as illustrated in the figure below. Each layer provides a different level of system abstraction to the embedded system developer.

<b>- Application Programming Interface (API) layer</b>
This software layer is the entry point for the system application. It provides a set of high level functions  allowing interaction with STMicroelectronics Secure Elements.

<b>- Service layer</b>
Provides a set of product services that format all commands supported by the targeted secure element and reports response to higher layers API/Application . This layer can be used directly from Application (for advanced user).

<b>- Core layer</b>
Contains generic definition for ST Secure Element and functions for communicating with target secure element.
